# SKILLUP

Hi Everyone, 👋
I'm a PG pursuing Student 🧑‍🎓, I choose SkillUp (Skill Enhancement Web App) as my major project because I have released many times that while studying hard to fulfill our dreams we tend to only focus on theortical part of our studies and ignore our natural skills, extra-curricular activities and interest which can be a good source of reducing Stress specially in student life and can help in improving focus.
But, The major problem arises is that from where we can get all these stuff ? Most of the resources on sites like Udemy, Skillshare are costly, so what about Unpreviledge or Financially Weak Students ?
Hence, considering all these thoughts, I have tried to develope ,SkillUp which can be used by anyone to follow up their interests and add some new skills in their Skillset through Video Lessons and Blogs. To make it more authenticate features like "Live session" had been added which makes learning a skill more easier and faster.
